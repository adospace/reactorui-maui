  "Summary": "Build complex, composable animations in MauiReactor using `AnimationController` with `SequenceAnimation`, `ParallelAnimation`, and tween/path animations.",
  "Remarks": "`AnimationController` is a `VisualNode` you place in your component tree to orchestrate animations via an internal timer you can Play, Pause, or Stop. It hosts a list of `Animation` nodes you compose into trees. Use `SequenceAnimation` to run child animations one-after-another; use `ParallelAnimation` to run them simultaneously. Tween animations like `DoubleAnimation` emit a numeric value from `StartValue` to `TargetValue` over `Duration`, optionally shaped by `Easing`. Path animations like `CubicBezierPathAnimation` and `QuadraticBezierPathAnimation` emit `Point` values along bezier curves (controlled via one or two control points). Compose multiple animations to drive UI properties on each `OnTick(...)` callback (e.g., position, opacity, scale). Keep durations and easings readable; prefer composable sequences for multi-step effects and parallel groups for combined motions. Manage controller lifecycle intentionally (start/stop on page appearing/disappearing) and avoid overly long or blocking operations inside `OnTick` to keep frames smooth.",
  "Example": "// Example animation tree\nnew AnimationController\n{\n    new SequenceAnimation\n    {\n        new DoubleAnimation()\n            .StartValue(0)\n            .TargetValue(300)\n            .Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2.5))\n            .Easing(Easing.CubicOut)\n            .OnTick(v => /* apply v to a property */),\n\n        new DoubleAnimation()\n            .StartValue(0)\n            .TargetValue(300)\n            .Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.5))\n            .OnTick(v => /* apply v */)\n    },\n\n    new ParallelAnimation\n    {\n        new CubicBezierPathAnimation()\n            .StartPoint(new Point(0,100))\n            .EndPoint(new Point(300,100))\n            .ControlPoint1(new Point(0,0))\n            .ControlPoint2(new Point(300,200))\n            .OnTick(p => /* move element to p */),\n\n        new QuadraticBezierPathAnimation()\n            .StartPoint(new Point(300,100))\n            .EndPoint(new Point(0,100))\n            .ControlPoint(new Point(150,200))\n            .OnTick(p => /* move element to p */)\n    }\n}\n\n// Control the controller (example):\n// controller.Play(); controller.Pause(); controller.Stop();"
