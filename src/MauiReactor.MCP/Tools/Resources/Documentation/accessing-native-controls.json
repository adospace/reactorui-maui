  "Summary": "How to access and manipulate the underlying MAUI native control from MauiReactor components.",
  "Remarks": "MauiReactor provides two primary mechanisms for interacting with native controls: (1) setting dependency properties on the underlying control, including attached properties; and (2) obtaining a direct reference to the native control instance for imperative operations (such as focusing an input, invoking methods, or reading state). Use `.Set(BindableProperty, value)` to assign a dependency property on the underlying MAUI control created by the component. For attached properties, use `.SetAttachedProperty(BindableProperty, value)`. When you need to call methods or access members on the native control, capture a reference by passing an action to the component constructor (e.g., `new Entry(entryRef => _entryRef = entryRef)`) and store it for later use (e.g., in a field). Prefer declarative bindings and properties where possible; reserve direct native access for scenarios that require imperative behavior or properties not exposed by the MauiReactor wrapper.",
  "Example": "public class MainPage : Component\n{\n    private MauiControls.Entry _entryRef;\n\n    public override VisualNode Render()\n    {\n        return new ContentPage\n        {\n            new VStack(spacing: 10)\n            {\n                new Entry(entryRef => _entryRef = entryRef),\n\n                new Button(\"Click here!\")\n                    .OnClick(OnButtonClicked)\n                    .VCenter()\n                    .HCenter()\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n    private void OnButtonClicked() => _entryRef?.Focus();\n}\n\n// Set dependency property\nnew Button().Set(SomeBindableProperty, someValue);\n\n// Set attached property\nnew Button().SetAttachedProperty(SomeAttachedProperty, someValue);"
